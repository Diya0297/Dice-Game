A fun Dice game created using ReactJS and designed using CSS. 
This game tests your luck by letting you guess the number and then roll the dice to see if your luck wins or not. If it does, it's a sign :).
I created this game with a complete beginner knowldge in ReactJS. This gave me opportunity to strengthen my concepts like state and pros handeling.
